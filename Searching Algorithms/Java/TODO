* Write all the search algorithms in different classes.
* Make one driving program containing the main to access all the search classes.
* Use java packages.

To continue adding the search algorithm:
* Make a class name of that algorithm name.
* include in the package asset as: package asset;
* write the .java files in algos directory.
* Compile the .java files as: `javac -d ../ <filename.java>`.
* Check if the .class file get added in the asset folder.
* To run these class files, include: `import asset.<file/algo_name>` in the **driving.java** (the driving program).
