//N is the limit, upto which we need to find ETF values
//phi[x] stores the ETF value of number x.
//Euler's totient function counts the positive integers up to a given integer N that are relatively prime to N. It is written using the Greek letter phi as φ(N) or ϕ(N), and may also be called Euler's phi function.

//In other words φ(N) is defined as number of integers K in the range 1 ≤ K ≤ N for which the greatest common divisor gcd(N, K) is equal to 1. The integers K of this form are called totatives of N.
