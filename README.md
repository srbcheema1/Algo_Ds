# Algo_Ds


## Overview:
This repo is a conglomeration of algorithms for competitive programming and learning data structures and Algorithms. You may learn a lot of different algorithms such as sorting, searching, and algorithms for graph theory, mathematical problems and Dynamic Programmng questions.The code for every algorithms  currently features C/C++, Python and some Java implementations.
There is use of features of C++ STL for easy implementation. The code are written in the most optimised form with having time analysis in Big Oh Notation.

Use this repo to study or review your knowledge and don't forget to star and collaborate!

## How to contribute:

Please comment your code thoroughly as to make it possible for anyone to understand.
If possible, check your code using unit tests. 
Avoid all the bad implementations, make your code as clean as possible.
After that, find the folder that fits the category of your code and submit a PR.
*Star* this repo if the information here is useful to you.
