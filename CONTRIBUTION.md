      <ul>
        <li>time complexity : </li>
        <li>space complexity : </li>
      </ul>
    <li>place your code in right directory</li>

  </ul>

<h4>you may add your solved questions on spoj codechef hackerearth hackerrank codeforces</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>first line of your code must begin with a comment mentioning the link of the question</li>
    <li>place the solutions in seperate folder "ques" in relevant directory</li>
  </ul>

        <li>description of your algorithm</li>
        <li>time and space complexity of your algorithm</li>
        <li>links to your fav online questions solvable by that algorithm</li>
          <ui>
            <li>you may also provide solution to that questions in "ques" folder in the same directory</li>

<h1>Best Practice of creating a Pull Request</h1>
  <li>The PR name should be meaningful.</li>
  <li>For e.g. 'Fixes #(issue-number): PR name, fixing the particular bug' (without commas)</li>
  <li>There should be always 1 commit for 1 PR</li>
  <li>If there are more than 1 commit in a PR, squash them.</li>
  <li>Pull Request details should be descriptive.</li>
  <li>Commit message should meaningful.</li>
