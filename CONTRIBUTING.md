<h1>Contributing Guidelines for Algo_Ds</h1>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to contribute to this project. Before making PRs, please note the following:</p>

<h3>A few norms you should follow</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Proper intendation is must!</li>
    <li>Include ample comments so that code is understandable and easy to follow.</li>
    <li>Mention the complexity of a function in a comment.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Time complexity : </li>
        <li>Space complexity : </li>
      </ul>
    <li>Place your code in right directory.</li>
    <li>Give your files names that are relevant and meaningful.</li>
  </ul>

<h4>You may add your solved questions on spoj, codechef, interviewbit, hackerearth, hackerrank and codeforces.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>First line of your code must begin with a comment mentioning the link of the question</li>
    <li>Place the solutions in seperate folder "ques" in relevant directory</li>
  </ul>

<h4>DESCRIPTION.md</h4>
  <p>If not already present, you are free to create a DESCRIPTION.md file in a folder: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Please write a brief description of your algorithm in DESCRIPTION.md file</li>
    <li>Suggestions of things to include in DESCRIPTION.md file:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Description of algorithm</li>
        <li>Time and space complexity of algorithm</li>
        <li>Links to your favourite online questions solvable by that algorithm</li>
          <ui>
            <li>You may also provide solution to related questions in "ques" folder in the same directory.</li>
            <li>Also, mention link of solution (if available) along with the question link.</li>
          </ui>
      </ul>
  </ul>

<h4>Best Practices for opening a Pull Request</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Give the PR a meaningful name.</li>
  <li>For e.g. 'Fixes #(issue-number): PR name, fixing the particular bug' (without commas)</li>
  <li>There should be always 1 commit for 1 PR.</li>
  <li>If there are more than 1 commit in a PR, squash them.</li>
  <li>Pull Request details should be descriptive.</li>
  <li>Commit message should meaningful.</li>
</ul>
